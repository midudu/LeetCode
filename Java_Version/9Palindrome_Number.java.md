/*Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. Do this without extra space.

  click to show spoilers.

  Some hints:
  
  Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1)

  If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.

  You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?

  There is a more generic way of solving this problem.*/

* (1) 这道题目不难，大概就是把integer逆序输出出来，而且不需要判断是否溢出，因为回文数不会溢出
