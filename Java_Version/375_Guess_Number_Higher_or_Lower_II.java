/*
  We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

    I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

    Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is
higher or lower.

    However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay
$x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

  Example:

    n = 10, I pick 8.

    First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
    Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
    Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

    Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

    You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.

  Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to
guarantee a win.
